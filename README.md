ASSIGNMENT 1: Module 2: Basic Python Concepts

Task 1 : Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

From the problem statement i understood that i need to have two numbers to perform 
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and those 2 number should be get from the user at runtime
So in the Code created 3 Sections
section  1: get the values from the user by using "input" and we also know that input will be numbers so using "int"
we can inform the system that input will be numbers
Section 2: created 4 variables and each variable we performed the mathematical operation.
Section 3: printing those 4 variables and mentioning those operations which they performed.

Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

From the problem statement I understood that i need to have the first name and the last name from the user at runtime
and creating a personalized Greeting.

So i created 3 Sections in the Code
Section 1: getting the input from the user
Section 2: creating a variable and adding the message as per the excepted output by combine the names in it 
Section 3: printing that variable as the output.
